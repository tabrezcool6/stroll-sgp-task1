# stroll_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Output 
Find the final output image and android apk file in the "OUTPUT" folder

## How to run the project
Type "flutter run" in root folder of the project.

## Note
The Flutter App is built using all the specifications mentioned in Figma File. However some properties like "Line Height", "Padding" do not match exact same values with the Flutter SDK. So I have put the values which resembles best to the Figma UI.
Fell free to contact in case of any changes need to be done.
